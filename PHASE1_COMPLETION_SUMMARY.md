# Phase 1: Dependency Modernization - Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 1 of the PyStore modernization has been successfully completed. All dependencies have been updated to modern versions and legacy code has been removed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Modern Build Configuration
- ✅ Created `pyproject.toml` with modern Python packaging standards
- ✅ Updated to support Python 3.9-3.12 only
- ✅ Added development dependencies for testing, linting, and type checking
- ✅ Configured black, ruff, mypy, pytest, and coverage tools

### 2. Updated Dependencies
- ✅ **Pandas**: 0.24.0 → 2.0.0+ (major upgrade)
- ✅ **PyArrow**: 15.0.2 → 15.0.0+ (maintained)
- ✅ **Dask**: dataframe → complete with 2024.1.0+
- ✅ **NumPy**: 1.17.3 → 1.24.0+
- ✅ **Python-snappy**: 0.5.4 → 0.6.1+
- ✅ Added **fsspec** 2023.1.0+ (new dependency for modern file system operations)

### 3. Removed Fastparquet
- ✅ Removed all Fastparquet references and imports
- ✅ Removed engine parameter from Store, Collection, and Item classes
- ✅ PyArrow is now the only supported parquet engine
- ✅ Removed the problematic `kwargs["times"] = "int96"` that caused PyArrow errors

### 4. Fixed Pandas 2.x Compatibility
- ✅ Removed deprecated `infer_datetime_format` parameter from `pd.to_datetime()`
- ✅ Added explicit `axis=0` to `dd.concat()` for clarity

### 5. Updated Dask Compatibility
- ✅ Ensured compatibility with Dask 2024.x
- ✅ No major API changes were needed for Dask

### 6. Removed Legacy Code
- ✅ Removed Python 2.7 and 3.5-3.8 support
- ✅ Removed pathlib2 fallback (using standard pathlib)
- ✅ Removed numba import workaround for old Fastparquet
- ✅ Removed unused console script entry point
- ✅ Added Windows to supported platforms

### 7. Version Update
- ✅ Updated version from 0.1.24 to 1.0.0-dev

## Files Modified
1. `pyproject.toml` - Created new modern build configuration
2. `requirements.txt` - Updated all dependencies
3. `setup.py` - Updated Python versions and platforms
4. `pystore/__init__.py` - Removed numba import, updated version
5. `pystore/store.py` - Removed engine parameter
6. `pystore/collection.py` - Removed engine parameter, fixed times issue
7. `pystore/item.py` - Removed engine parameter, fixed pandas deprecation
8. `pystore/utils.py` - Removed pathlib2 fallback

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test_modernization.py` - Tests basic functionality and edge cases
- Tests cover: store creation, data writing/reading, append operations, snapshots, metadata

## Impact Assessment

### Potentially Auto-Fixed Issues
Based on the dependency updates, these issues may now be resolved:
1. **#75** - PyArrow TypeError with 'times' parameter - FIXED (removed the problematic line)
2. **#72** - pathlib.Path handling - Likely improved with modern pathlib
3. **#70** - Dask/PyArrow compatibility - FIXED (removed Fastparquet)
4. **#64** - Pandas warnings - FIXED (updated to Pandas 2.x APIs)
5. **#42** - Dask 2.2.0+ performance - Should be improved with Dask 2024.x

### Known Remaining Issues
These issues will need to be addressed in Phase 2:
1. Data loss in append operations (#65, #69, #48, etc.)
2. Silent failures and poor error handling
3. Memory efficiency problems
4. Platform-specific path issues (may need additional work)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
With the modern dependency foundation in place, Phase 2 will focus on:
1. Fixing the critical append operation bugs
2. Implementing proper error handling
3. Addressing remaining platform-specific issues
4. Adding comprehensive logging

## Migration Notes
Users upgrading from 0.1.24 to 1.0.0 will need to:
1. Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed
2. Update their code to remove any engine parameter usage
3. Re-install with updated dependencies
4. May need to update metadata files from `metadata.json` to `pystore_metadata.json`

## Conclusion
Phase 1 has successfully modernized PyStore's dependency stack and removed legacy code. The codebase is now ready for Phase 2, where we'll address the critical bugs that weren't automatically fixed by the modernization.
